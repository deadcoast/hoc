## Continuity Spine (**C-SP**)

The C-SP is the vertical conduit that collects and distributes **flow** across three **Spine Columns** (**SC**):

1. **M-SC (Main):** center column; routes flow among `CHO → ACT → DEC → ABT → DEF`, aggregates `ent` + variables.
2. **E-SC (Emotional):** left column; anchors `emo` essentials and **`ev*`** variables.
3. **P-SC (Physical):** right column; anchors `phl` essentials and **`pv*`** variables.

The **Triple V** (`v     v     v`) on line `|02|` denotes simultaneous downward propagation on **E-SC**, **M-SC**, **P-SC** when a `CHO` is made.

## Flow (flo)

Flow represents directed movement of state through the columns and nodes.

### `MD-flo` (Multi-directional flow) [DD]

- A construct is **MD-flo** when it must have **balanced, side-aware** impacts on both **E-SC (emo)** and **P-SC (phl)**.
- Marked **[DD]** because semantics depend on side.
- **Validity rule:** If a construct traverses the **C-SP**, it must present **paired counterparts**:
  -> `<+emo>` and `<+phl>` with **comparable, constructive effect**. If parity is missing, it **does not qualify** as CAH-valid flow on the C-SP.

## Flow Indicators (**FID**) [DD]

FID are symbols that frame how flows open/branch/close relative to the **C-SP**.

- **Positive (openers on C-SP):** `+>`, `<+`

  - Create a **new connection** to/from the C-SP for essentials/variables.
  - **Rule:** the `+` is on the **open** (greater-than) side of the arrow: e.g., `<+`, `+>`.
  - **Required** when a flow **enters** the C-SP or **exits** it with intent to (re)bind essentials/variables.

- **Neutral (branchers):** `>`, `<`  [DD]

  - Branch off the C-SP without changing binding state.
  - Side semantics still apply (left = emo, right = phl).

- **Closing Negative (sealers):** `-<`, `>-`  [DD]

  - **Close** a previously opened positive flow; package it as a **single block** for the C-SP.
  - **Rule:** the `-` is on the **closed** (less-than) side of the arrow: `-<`, `>-`.
  - Designed to complete flows and **reintegrate** their essentials/variables as new **`ent`** on the C-SP.

## Essentials (**ent**) and Variables

- Each side maintains its own **essential** context: `emo` (left) and `phl` (right).
- Variables must be **side-keyed** for clarity and parity:

  - Emotional variables: **`evb`, `ev2`, …**
  - Physical variables: **`pvb`, `pv2`, …**
- When crossing the **C-SP**, variable contributions **must** be paired (*MD-flo rule*) or the flow is **invalid** for CAH purposes.

## Nodes & Intent

- **`[CHO]`**: A deliberate selection; triggers **Triple V** spine descent.
- **`[ACT]`** *(diagram)*: Concrete behavior initiated by `CHO`.
- **`[DEC]`**: Formal declaration of intent/state (auditable).
- **`[{ABT}]`**: **Absolute** gate; only balanced (MD-flo) flows should pass.
- **`<!DEF!>`**: Definition sink/output—materializes updated essentials/variables (system commits).

## Examples & Explanations (aligned to your lines)

**EE.1 — Triple V (`v     v     v`)**
A `CHO` triggers **simultaneous** descent on **E-SC**, **M-SC**, **P-SC**. This enforces that every choice propagates emotional, main, and physical implications together.

**EE.2 — `│  vb2}>│+<[{ABT}]` (corrected to side-keyed vars)**
Interpretation with side-keying: an emotional-side variable (e.g., `ev2`) pushes toward **`[{ABT}]`**;
-> to bring it into the **C-SP**, you must use an **Opening Flow Indicator** (e.g., `+<`) so the contribution binds inside the spine.
-> Mirror with a physical counterpart (`pv2`) to satisfy **MD-flo**.

**EE.3 — Secured Flow: `v<+│   > v <   │+>v`**

- Two negatives branch off, traverse the spine, and get closed appropriately—resulting in **externally** created flows that still **respect side semantics** (`v` left = emo, mirrored right = phl).
- Because **`+`** appears flanking the C-SP bars, this shows **enter/exit** bindings at the spine boundaries.

**EE.4 — `>-│+<[{ABT}]>+│-<`**

- A negative closer on the left (`>-`) pairs with an opening into **`[{ABT}]`** (`+<`), then a reopen on the right (`>+`), and final close on the right (`-<`).
- Net effect: both sides **close** and feed **paired** essentials/variables back into the **C-SP** as **new `ent`** (parity satisfied).
